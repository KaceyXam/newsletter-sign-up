## My process

### What I learned

This project helped me udnerstand how to use Vue and Pinia better. Vue is a frontend UI framework for building progressive web apps. Pinia is a state management library for Vue. Pinia is designed to be very modular, so it can be easier to work with in a major project with a lot of data stores.
